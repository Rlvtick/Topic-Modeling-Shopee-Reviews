  # Topic Modeling 1-Star Shopee Reviews

</div>

This repository showcases my contribution to a project focused on Topic Modeling for Shopee's Star Reviews in the Indonesian language. The main goal is to uncover insights into the prevalent topics within each star review. I specifically undertook the challenge of conducting topic modeling for the 1-Star Reviews. Moreover, the project seeks to evaluate and pinpoint the most effective algorithm for this task. The three algorithms employed in this project are **Latent Dirichlet Allocation (LDA)**, **Non-Negative Matrix Factorization (NMF)**, and **BERTopic**. The evaluation metrics utilized encompass **Topic Diversity** and **Coherence Score**.
